      <h1>The Art of War</h1>
      <div class="meta">by Sun Tzu</div>
      <div class='cover nocover'>cover image not found</div>
      <div class="section">Chapter I. LAYING PLANS</div>
      <p>[Ts’ao Kung, in defining the meaning of the Chinese for the title of

this chapter, says it refers to the deliberations in the temple

selected by the general for his temporary use, or as we should say, in

his tent. See. § 26.]

1. Sun Tzŭ said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.

2. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to

ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be

neglected.

3. The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be

taken into account in one’s deliberations, when seeking to determine

the conditions obtaining in the field.

4. These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The

Commander; (5) Method and discipline.

[It appears from what follows that Sun Tzŭ means by "Moral Law" a

principle of harmony, not unlike the Tao of Lao Tzŭ in its moral

aspect. One might be tempted to render it by "morale," were it not

considered as an attribute of the _ruler_ in § 13.]

5, 6. _The Moral Law_ causes the people to be in complete accord with

their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives,

undismayed by any danger.

[Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzŭ as saying: "Without constant practice, the

officers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle;

without constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute

when the crisis is at hand."]

7. _Heaven_ signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.

[The commentators, I think, make an unnecessary mystery of two words

here. Meng Shih refers to "the hard and the soft, waxing and waning" of

Heaven. Wang Hsi, however, may be right in saying that what is meant is

"the general economy of Heaven," including the five elements, the four

seasons, wind and clouds, and other phenomena.]

8. _Earth_ comprises distances, great and small; danger and security;

open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.

9. _The Commander_ stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity,

benevolence, courage and strictness.

[The five cardinal virtues of the Chinese are (1) humanity or

benevolence; (2) uprightness of mind; (3) self-respect, self-control,

or "proper feeling;" (4) wisdom; (5) sincerity or good faith. Here

"wisdom" and "sincerity" are put before "humanity or benevolence," and

the two military virtues of "courage" and "strictness" substituted for

"uprightness of mind" and "self-respect, self-control, or ‘proper

feeling.’"]

10. By _Method and discipline_ are to be understood the marshalling of

the army in its proper subdivisions, the gradations of rank among the

officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the

army, and the control of military expenditure.

11. These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows

them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.

12. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the

military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in

this wise:—

13. (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law?

[I.e., "is in harmony with his subjects." Cf. § 5.]

(2) Which of the two generals has most ability?

(3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth?

[See §§ 7, 8]

(4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?
