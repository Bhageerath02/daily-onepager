      <h1>Essays: Self-Reliance</h1>
      <div class="meta">by Ralph Waldo Emerson</div>
      <div class='cover nocover'>cover image not found</div>
      <div class="section">book of essays, entitled _Nature_, which appeared in 1836. In the</div>
      <p>years which followed, he thought more deeply on the subject and,

according to his custom, made notes about it and entries in his

journals. In the winter of 1843 he delivered a lecture on _Relation to

Nature_, and it is probable that this essay is built up from that. The

plan of it, however, had been long in his mind: In 1840 he wrote in

his journal: "I think I must do these eyes of mine the justice to

write a new chapter on Nature. This delight we all take in every show

of night or day or field or forest or sea or city, down to the lowest

particulars, is not without sequel, though we be as yet only wishers

and gazers, not at all knowing what we want. We are predominated here

as elsewhere by an upper wisdom, and resemble those great discoverers

who are haunted for years, sometimes from infancy, with a passion for

the fact, or class of facts in which the secret lies which they are

destined to unlock, and they let it not go until the blessing is won.

So these sunsets and starlights, these swamps and rocks, these bird

notes and animal forms off which we cannot get our eyes and ears, but

hover still, as moths round a lamp, are no doubt a Sanscrit cipher

covering the whole religious history of the universe, and presently we

shall read it off into action and character. The pastures are full of

ghosts for me, the morning woods full of angels."]

[Footnote 470: There are days, etc. The passage in Emerson's journal

is hardly less beautiful. Under date of October 30, 1841, he wrote:

"On this wonderful day when heaven and earth seem to glow with

magnificence, and all the wealth of all the elements is put under

contribution to make the world fine, as if Nature would indulge her

offspring, it seemed ungrateful to hide in the house. Are there not

dull days enough in the year for you to write and read in, that you

should waste this glittering season when Florida and Cuba seem to have

left their glittering seats and come to visit us with all their

shining hours, and almost we expect to see the jasmine and cactus

burst from the ground instead of these last gentians and asters which

have loitered to attend this latter glory of the year? All insects are

out, all birds come forth, the very cattle that lie on the ground seem

to have great thoughts, and Egypt and India look from their eyes."]

[Footnote 471: Halcyons. Halcyon days, ones of peace and tranquillity;

anciently, days of calm weather in mid-winter, when the halcyon, or

kingfisher, was supposed to brood. It was fabled that this bird laid

its eggs in a nest that floated on the sea, and that it charmed the

winds and waves to make them calm while it brooded.]

[Footnote 472: Indian Summer. Calm, dry, hazy weather which comes in

the autumn in America. The Century Dictionary says it was called

Indian Summer because the season was most marked in the sections of

the upper eastern Mississippi valley inhabited by Indians about the

time the term became current.]

[Footnote 473: Gabriel. One of the seven archangels. The Hebrew name

means "God is my strong one."]

[Footnote 474: Uriel. Another of the seven archangels; the name means

"Light of God."]

[Footnote 475: Converts all trees to wind-harps. Compare with this</p>
