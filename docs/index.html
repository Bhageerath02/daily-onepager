      <div class="section">BOOK II "Both to frequent" (4). Gr. τὸ μή, C. conjectures τὸ μὲ. The</div>
      <p>text is probably right: "I did not frequent public lectures, and I was

taught at home."

VI Idiots.... philosophers (9). The reading is doubtful, but the meaning

seems to be: "simple and unlearned men"

XII "Claudius Maximus" (15). The reading of the Palatine MS. (now lost)

was paraklhsiz Maximon, which C. supposes to conceal the letters kl as

an abbreviation of Claudius.

XIII "Patient hearing... He would not" (16). C. translates his

conjectural reading epimonon ollan. on proapsth Stich suggests a reading

with much the same sense: .....epimonon all antoi "Strict and rigid

dealing" (16). C. translates tonvn (Pal. MS.) as though from tonoz,

in the sense of "strain." "rigour." The reading of other MSS. tonvn is

preferable.

XIII "Congiaries" (13). dianomais, "doles."

XIV "Cajeta" (17). The passage is certainly corrupt. C. spies a

reference to Chryses praying by the sea-shore in the Illiad, and

supposes M. Aurelius to have done the like. None of the emendations

suggested is satisfactory. At § XV. Book II. is usually reckoned to

begin. BOOK II III. "Do, soul" (6). If the received reading be right,

it must be sarcastic; but there are several variants which show how

unsatisfactory it is. C. translates "en gar o bioz ekasty so par eanty",

which I do not understand. The sense required is: "Do not violence to

thyself, for thou hast not long to use self-respect. Life is not (v. 1.

so long for each, and this life for thee is all but done."

X. "honour and credit do proceed" (12). The verb has dropt out of the

text, but C. has supplied one of the required meaning.

XI. "Consider," etc. (52). This verb is not in the Greek, which means:

"(And reason also shows) how man, etc."</p>
