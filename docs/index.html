PREFACE

The Institute standard course of study in "Commercial Law" is not

intended to make lawyers, but simply to impart to bankers sufficient

knowledge of law to enable them to act in accordance with established

legal principles, and refer doubtful questions to a lawyer. It is not

usurping the functions of a lawyer for a banker to know his legal rights

and responsibilities. The banker who does not appreciate the importance

of this knowledge, eventually learns from experience, sad or otherwise,

that he has neglected an important part of the training necessary to

carry on his business with safety and confidence. This text-book is

based on the splendid work, originally prepared for the Institute, by

Samuel Williston, Weld Professor of Law in Harvard Law School. To this

original matter, however, much new material has been added, cases have

been cited, and new chapters on Master and Servant, Estates and Trusts,

Bills and Notes, and Torts and Crimes added. The work of preparing

"Commercial Law" has been done jointly by Richard D. Currier, President

of the New Jersey Law School, and Richard W. Hill, member of the New

York Bar and Secretary of the American Institute of Banking. The main

purpose of this book is to teach bankers to recognize the danger signals

in law, when they appear, and thus be able to distinguish between law

and law suits.

INSTITUTE PLATFORM

Resolution adopted at the New Orleans Convention of the American

Institute of Banking, October 9, 1919:

"Ours is an educational association organized for the benefit of the

banking fraternity of the country and within our membership may be found

on an equal basis both employees and employers; and in full appreciation

of the opportunities which our country and its established institutions

afford, and especially in appreciation of the fact that the profession

of banking affords to its diligent and loyal members especial

opportunities for promotion to official and managerial positions, and

that as a result of the establishment and maintenance of the merit

system in most banks a large number of Institute members have through

individual application achieved marked professional success, we at all

times and under all circumstances stand for the merit system and for the

paying of salaries according to the value of the service rendered.

"We believe in the equitable cooperation of employees and employers and

are opposed to all attempts to limit individual initiative and curtail

production, and, insofar as our profession is concerned, are unalterably

opposed to any plan purporting to promote the material welfare of our

members, individually or collectively, on any other basis than that of

efficiency, loyalty and unadulterated Americanism."
